Systems Architect | SoC Bring-up & Linux Kernel EngineerLow-Level Specialist | Automotive Tech Veteran | Smart Infrastructure Developer

📖 About Me
I am a Senior Embedded Systems Architect with over 30 years of experience taking raw silicon and turning it into mission-critical industrial products. 
My career is rooted in the high-stakes world of professional automation and automotive diagnostics, where I served as a key player in developing world-class tools for one of the industry's most prestigious manufacturers.

I specialize in Board Bring-up—the delicate art of making custom hardware breathe. 
From writing the first line of a bootloader to optimizing real-time Linux kernel drivers, I bridge the gap between complex electrical engineering and high-level software application.

🏛️ Technical Pillars
  🐧 Linux Kernel & SoC ExpertiseI don't just use Linux; I architect the platforms it runs on.
  SoC Mastery: Expert-level bring-up for i.MX8, i.MX53, Rockchip RK35xx, and AT91.
  Kernel Development: Custom driver design, Device Tree (DTS) authoring, IRQ optimization, and PREEMPT_RT implementation for deterministic performance.

Platform Engineering: 
  Buildroot : I build entire OS stacks from scratch, integrating kernel, drivers, libraries, and custom browser-based UIs.
  🚗 Automotive & Industrial SafetyComing from a professional automotive background, "safety-first" is my default setting.

Protocols: Deep-level integration of OBD-II, CAN-bus, and ECU flash loaders.
  Hardware Interfacing: FPGA-to-CPU communication, Linux FPGA drivers, and bit-bang JTAG protocols.
  Connectivity: Ethernet PHY bring-up, WiFi/SDMMC integration, and multi-session Bluetooth (HCI/RFCOMM/SDP).

💾 Legacy ModernizationI have a unique "Full-Timeline" perspective, capable of migrating legacy infrastructure into the modern era.
  Bare Metal & Assembly: Deep roots in x86, Z80, 6502, 6303, and 68HC12.
  Migration: Successfully transitioned multiple generations of industrial controllers from DOS/x86 and 8-bit MCUs to 32/64-bit ARM Linux.
