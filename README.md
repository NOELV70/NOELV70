From writing the first line of a bootloader to optimizing real-time Linux kernel drivers — I bridge the gap between complex electrical engineering and high-level software applications
<br>
<br>
🏛️ Technical Pillars<br>
  🐧 Linux Kernel & SoC Expertise<br>
  I don't just use Linux; I architect the platforms it runs on.<br>
  SoC Mastery: Expert-level bring-up for i.MX8, i.MX53, Rockchip RK35xx, and AT91, x86, MIPS, ESP8266, ESP32 , Arm-Cortex (and others ..:-) .<br>
  Kernel Development: Custom driver design, Device Tree (DTS) authoring, IRQ optimization, and PREEMPT_RT implementation for deterministic performance.<br>

Platform Engineering: <br>
  Buildroot : I build entire OS stacks from scratch, integrating kernel, drivers, libraries, and custom browser-based UI's.<br>
  🚗 Automotive & Industrial Safety <br>
  Coming from a professional automotive and automation background, "safety-first" is my default setting.<br>

Protocols: Deep-level integration of OBD-II (bench/boot/and bdm-modes), CAN bus, ECU flash loaders, and custom protocols.<br>
  Hardware Interfacing: FPGA-to-CPU integration, Linux FPGA drivers, and bit-banged JTAG protocols, etc.<br>
  Connectivity: Ethernet PHY bring-up, Wi-Fi/SDMMC integration, and multi-session Bluetooth (HCI/RFCOMM/SDP).<br>

💾 Legacy Modernization: I have a unique "Full-Timeline" perspective, capable of migrating legacy infrastructure into the modern era.<br>
  Bare Metal & Assembly: Deep roots in Z80, 6502, 6303, and 68HC12, x86.....<br>
  Successfully transitioned multiple generations of industrial controllers from native,DOS, 8-bit MCUs to x86 32/64-bit windows and ARM 32/64bit Linux.<br>
  
🛠️ The Technical Stack : Category Expertise<br>
  Architectures ARM/ARM64, x86-64, FPGA, 8-bit MCU<br>
  Operating Systems Linux Kernel, RTOS, Bare-Metal, WinCE, DOS TSR<br>
  Communication CAN, Ethernet (TCP/IP), BLE, RS485/RS422/4-20mA, I2C, SPI, WIFI<br>
  Storage NAND/eMMC, UBIFS, JFFS2, MTD/ECC, Secure Boot<br>
  Displays MIPI-DSI, LVDS, RGB Panels, Backlight/Timing Control<br>
<br>
📊 Knowledge Timeline <br>
Knowledge Timeline <br>
1990s: Bare-metal assembly, 8/16-bit industrial controllers, and DOS-based TSR tools.<br>
Mid-1990s: Ethernet networking, MCP+I (NetBIOS APIs, NetBEUI, TCP/IP, IPX/SPX, NetBIOS wrappers for IP networks), etc.<br>
2000s: Windows (Win32, Windows 95, Windows 98, Windows NT, Windows 2000, WinCE 3.0/4.0) and device drivers.<br>
2003: Wireless – Bluetooth, Wi-Fi.<br>
2005: Buildroot Linux kernel + rootfs specialization and professional IoT.<br>
2010s: ARM SoC migration (AT91SAM9x, i.MX53, Cortex-Mx).<br>
2020s: ARM64 architectures (i.MX8, RK356x).<br>
