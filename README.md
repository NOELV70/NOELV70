From writing the first line of a bootloader to optimizing real-time Linux kernel drivers, I bridge the gap between complex electrical engineering and high-level software application.

🏛️ Technical Pillars
  🐧 Linux Kernel & SoC ExpertiseI don't just use Linux; I architect the platforms it runs on.
  SoC Mastery: Expert-level bring-up for i.MX8, i.MX53, Rockchip RK35xx, and AT91, x86, MIPS, ESP8266, ESP32 , Arm-Cortex (and others ..:-) .
  Kernel Development: Custom driver design, Device Tree (DTS) authoring, IRQ optimization, and PREEMPT_RT implementation for deterministic performance.

Platform Engineering: 
  Buildroot : I build entire OS stacks from scratch, integrating kernel, drivers, libraries, and custom browser-based UIs.
  🚗 Automotive & Industrial Safety 
  Coming from a professional automotive and automation background, "safety-first" is my default setting.

Protocols: Deep-level integration of OBD-II, CAN-bus, and ECU flash loaders.
  Hardware Interfacing: FPGA-to-CPU, Linux FPGA drivers, and bit-bang JTAG protocols..etc.
  Connectivity: Ethernet PHY bring-up, WiFi/SDMMC integration, and multi-session Bluetooth (HCI/RFCOMM/SDP).

💾 Legacy ModernizationI have a unique "Full-Timeline" perspective, capable of migrating legacy infrastructure into the modern era.
  Bare Metal & Assembly: Deep roots in Z80, 6502, 6303, and 68HC12, x86.....
  Successfully transitioned multiple generations of industrial controllers from native,DOS, 8-bit MCUs to x86 32/64-bit windows and  ARM 32/64bit Linux.
